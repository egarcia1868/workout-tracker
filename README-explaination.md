This is a simple app for saving information about workouts completed throughout the week.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running simply clone this repo onto your computer, install the required dependencies by entering "npm i" in the terminal inside the cloned directory.  To run this project from there, simply enter node server.js in the same directory in your terminal.
